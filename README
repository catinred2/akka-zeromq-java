This is code from my CIJUG talk on Actors.  I presented things in this order:
1) akka/AsyncSend
2) akka/AsyncRequestReply
3) akka/Pi <=== this is the one that pegged my 8-core machine to 100% CPU for about 14 secs
4) akka/weather
5) zeromq/Server & Client
6) zeromq/Publisher & Subscriber
7) akkazeromq

The pom defines the Akka dependencies, but 0MQ isn't in any maven repos I can find, so zmq.jar is included in the lib directory just to get everything to compile.

To actually run the 0MQ examples you'll need both the 0MQ C library as well as the 0MQ JNI library.
